Sorting algorithms with test cases


- bubble
- insert
- quicksort (Lomuto's partition, median of three for pivot)


# TODO
- [ ] merge sort
- [ ] heaps
- [ ] heap sort (what about dups)
- [ ] linked lists
- [ ] dutch flag
- [ ] cycle detection in linked lists
- [ ] find size of cycle
- [ ] find start of cycle
- [ ] mitigate
- [ ] QuickSelect (complexity? best case O(n)?)
- [ ] external sort
- [ ] produce median of array that grows by one (online sorting, why not heapsort?)
- [ ] LRU cache
- [ ] MinStack
- [ ] Skip Lists (when they can be useful)
- [ ] deatailed chart of all sorts: their best, average and worst time omplexity; space complexity; stability; possible improvements
- [ ] Will my current quicksort work for duplicates? why is not stabble? code quicksort for arrays with duplicates + stable version
- [ ] quicksort: Lomuto vs Hoarse's, code Hoarse
